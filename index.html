<h3>Brief Bio</h3>
Hello! I'm Gautham Krishna Gudur, and I work as a Data Scientist at <strong><i><a href="https://www.ericsson.com/" target="_blank">Ericsson R&D</a></i></strong>, in the <i>Global AI Accelerator (GAIA)</i> team. I also do independent research at an intersection of machine learning and ubiqitous computing. My current research theme is <i>Data-efficient AI</i>. Previously, I worked at an AI assisted wearable health-care startup called <strong><i><a href="https://www.smartcardia.com/" target="_blank">SmartCardia</a></i></strong> (a spin-off from <strong><i><a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/" target="_blank">EPFL</a></i></strong>, Switzerland). You can find more about me <a href="/aboutme">here</a>.

<b>Research Interests</b>
<br>
My research interests span across multiple domains, and I would like to have an interdisciplinary aspect to the same.

<br><br>Keywords that might best describe my present and past interests:<br><br>
Machine (Deep, On-Device/Resource-Constrained, Bayesian, Incremental/Continual, Active, Federated, Meta, Reinforcement) Learning, Data Efficient AI, Ubiquitous Computing, Activity Recognition, Computer Vision, Audio Sensing, Pervasive Healthcare, AI4SocialGood, NLP, IoT, Time-series Analysis, Anomaly Detection
