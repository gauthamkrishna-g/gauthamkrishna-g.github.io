<h3>Brief Bio</h3>
I'm Gautham Krishna Gudur, and I work as a Data Scientist at <strong><i><a href="https://www.ericsson.com/" target="_blank">Ericsson R&D</a></i></strong>, where I work with the <i>Global AI Accelerator (GAIA)</i> team. I also do independent research in Machine Learning (Deep, Uncertain, on-device) and Ubiqitous & Wearable Computing. You can find more about me <a href="/aboutme">here</a>.
<br><br>

<b>Research Interests</b>
<br>
My research interests span an intersection of multiple domains, and I would like to have an interdisciplinary touch to the same.

<br><br>Keywords that might best describe my past and current works:<br><br>
Machine (Deep) Learning, Ubiquitous & Wearable Computing, On-Device ML, Activity Recognition, Applied Healthcare, Incremental (Continual) Learning, Federated Learning, Mobile Sensing, Bayesian ML, IoT, Active Learning, Audio Processing, Computer Vision, NLP, Sensor-based HCI, Time-series Analysis, Anomaly Detection
