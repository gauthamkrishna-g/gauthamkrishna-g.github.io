<h3>Brief Bio</h3>
I'm Gautham Krishna Gudur, and I work as a Data Scientist at <strong><i><a href="https://www.ericsson.com/" target="_blank">Ericsson R&D</a></i></strong>, where I work with the <i>Global AI Accelerator (GAIA)</i> team. I also do independent research at an intersection of Machine Learning (Deep, Uncertain, On-device) and Ubiqitous Computing. You can find more about me <a href="/aboutme">here</a>.
<br><br>

<b>Research Interests</b>
<br>
My research interests span multiple domains, and I would like to have an interdisciplinary aspect to the same.

<br><br>Keywords that might best describe my present and past interests:<br><br>
Machine (Deep, On-Device, Bayesian, Incremental/Continual, Federated, Reinforcement, Active) Learning, Ubiquitous & Wearable Computing, Activity Recognition, Applied Healthcare, Mobile Sensing, Audio Sensing, Computer Vision, NLP, Sensor-based HCI, IoT, Time-series Analysis, Anomaly Detection
