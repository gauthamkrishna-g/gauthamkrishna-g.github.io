<h3>Brief Bio</h3>
I am currently a <i>Data Scientist</i> at <strong><i><a href="https://www.ericsson.com/" target="_blank">Ericsson R&D</a></i></strong>, in the <i>Global AI Accelerator (GAIA)</i> team. I also do independent research broadly at an intersection of Machine Learning and Ubiquitous Computing with a broad research theme of <i>Resource-Efficient AI</i>. Previously, I worked as a <i>Machine Learning Engineer</i> at an AI assisted wearable health-care startup called <strong><i><a href="https://www.smartcardia.com/" target="_blank">SmartCardia</a></i></strong> (a spin-off from <strong><i><a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/" target="_blank">EPFL</a></i></strong>, Switzerland).<br><br>

In a past life, I was a <i>Research Assistant</i> at <strong><i><a href="https://www.solarillionfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Solarillion Foundation</a></i></strong>, and I earned a Bachelor's in Information Technology from <strong><i><a href="https://www.ssn.edu.in/" target="_blank">SSN College of Engineering</a></i></strong>, Chennai. You can find more about me <b><a href="/aboutme">here</a></b>, and about my work experience <b><a href="/experience">here</a></b>.
<br><br>

<b>Research Interests</b>
<br>
My research interests span across multiple domains with a good mix of theory and applied ML, and I would like to have an interdisciplinary aspect to the same.

<br><br>Keywords that might best describe my present and past interests (and hopefully in the future!):<br><br>
Machine (Deep, On-Device/Resource-Constrained, Bayesian, Incremental/Continual, Active, Federated, Meta, Reinforcement) Learning, Resource/Data-Efficient AI, Ubiquitous Computing, Activity Recognition, Computer Vision, Audio Sensing, Mobile Health, NLP, IoT, Time-series Analysis, Anomaly Detection, Telecom, ML4D
