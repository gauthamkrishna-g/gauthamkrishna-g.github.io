Gautham Krishna Gudur is a Data Scientist at Ericsson R&D in the Global AI Accelerator (GAIA) team at Chennai, India. He works on incorporating machine learning for network intelligence at an intersection of telecom, computer vision, IoT, reinforcement learning, time-series, NLP. Currently working on projects like mobility prediction in 5G, on-mobile object localization/segmentation, etc. He is also involved in conceptualizing and developing E-ADF - an end-to-end anomaly detection framework. He also does independent research on a variety of research topics like machine/deep learning, incremental/continual learning, Bayesian deep learning, ML for limited labeled data, physical activity sensing using on-device sensors and wearables, computer vision, active learning, ubiquitous computing. His broad research themes are into resource-constrained and resource-efficient learning. Previously, he worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at SmartCardia, EPFL, where he dealt with combining medical wearables with AI for actionable and unique insights into patients' health, and developed deep learning models for analyzing biomarkers of various patients. He has also been a Research Assistant at Solarillion Foundation, where he conducted research in fields of human activity recognition, gesture recognition, on-device deep learning, ubiquitous computing, IoT and demand forecasting. He was also a Teaching Assistant on embedded programming at SF. Gautham received his Bachelor's degree in Information Technology at SSN College of Engineering, Chennai where he was an undergrad student researcher and worked on funded research projects in areas of IoT, EEG-based HCI, ML and pervasive urban analytics. He also enjoys competitive coding in online platforms like HackerRank, featuring in the top 1% in advanced algorithms and problem solving. In his time away from research, he considerably enjoys Indian classical and world music, travelling, badminton and DotA.
